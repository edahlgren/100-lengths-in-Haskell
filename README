This is an ambitious project to come up with 100 Haskell implementations of length of list.  It involves thinking about a very simple problem incredibly creatively, requiring better and better knowledge of Haskell to pull this off.  

Objectives:

     - 100 lengths functions in Haskell
     - Comparison of what makes a good and bad length function
     - Description of different types of monads
     - Runtime, Big O notation, and general complexity notes on each function
     - Repetition of the problem in each new function: should
       help those learning Haskell compare new concepts to old ones easily
     - Creativity and fun
