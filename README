This is a slightly insane project to come up with 100 Haskell implementations of a length of list function.  The journey involves thinking about a very simple problem incredibly creatively, forcing a deepening knowledge of Haskell, in order to actually pull this off.  What will come out:

     - Obviously 100 lengths functions in Haskell
     - Comparison of what makes a good and bad length function
     - Lucid description of different types of monads
     - Runtime, Big O notation, and general complexity notes on each function
     - Repetition of the problem in each new function: should
       help those learning Haskell compare new concepts to old ones easily
     
     - A hell of a lot of fun
